2.1 The configure script
========================

This package uses a configure script generated using GNU Autoconf. You
can get a summary of the available options by running
     ./configure --help

In the unlikely event that all of the dependencies are installed in
standard locations and you don't need any special compiler flags, you
might get away with just doing
     ./configure --prefix=<path>
     make
     make install

where `<path>' is the directory where the program should be installed.


File: mgpt.info,  Node: Dependencies,  Next: Specifying compilers and flags,  Prev: The configure script,  Up: Compilation

2.2 Dependencies
================

In order to compile the program you need at least a C compiler, a
Fortran 90 compiler, and the GTK+ 2.0 GUI library. The program also has
several optional dependencies:

   * HDF5  : allows reading of HDF5 snapshots. The HDF5 Fortran
     interface is not required.

   * libpng: required for writing out movie frames and screenshots

   * PlPlot or Cairo: to make scatterplots and histograms of particle
     properties. Cairo is now used by GTK so PLPlot is only necessary
     if you have a very old version of GTK.

   If any of these are missing, some features will be unavailable. The
configure script generates a warning for each library which can't be
found.


File: mgpt.info,  Node: Specifying compilers and flags,  Next: Specifying library locations,  Prev: Dependencies,  Up: Compilation

2.3 Specifying compilers and flags
==================================

The compilers to use can be specified by setting the following
environment variables before running the configure script:

   * CC      - sets the C compiler

   * CFLAGS  - sets C compiler flags to use (e.g. optimization)

   * FC      - sets the Fortran 90 compiler

   * FCFLAGS - sets Fortran compiler flags to use (e.g. optimization or
     module file locations)


File: mgpt.info,  Node: Specifying library locations,  Prev: Specifying compilers and flags,  Up: Compilation

2.4 Specifying library locations
================================

If libraries are installed in non-standard locations (i.e. not
somewhere like /usr/lib), the following parameters can be used to tell
configure where to find the libraries:
         --with-hdf5=...           - specify path to HDF5
         --with-plplot=...         - specify path to PlPlot
         --with-png=...            - specify path to libpng

The supplied directory should contain the 'include' and 'lib'
subdirectories for the corresponding library. E.g. if libhdf5.so is in
/opt/local/hdf5/current/lib/ then you would use
     ./configure --with-hdf5=/opt/local/hdf5/current/

The program can be compiled without a particular library by doing
something like:
     ./configure --without-hdf5

If you're having problems linking a library you can use the LIBS and
LDFLAGS environment variables to pass extra flags to the linker.

3 Reading simulation data
*************************

* Menu:

* Reading snapshots::
* Reading group catalogues::
* Reading additional arrays::


File: mgpt.info,  Node: Reading snapshots,  Next: Reading group catalogues,  Up: Reading simulation data

3.1 Reading snapshots
=====================

Snapshot files can be read in either by specifying the name of one file
at the command line or using the "Read Gadget snapshot" option in the
File menu. In either case, all files in the snapshot are read.

   All three formats described in the documentation for the public
version of Gadget-2 can be read.

3.1.1 Gadget type 1 binary
--------------------------

Type 1 binary snapshots consist of a header followed by a series of
Fortran records containing the particle data. Since these files contain
very little metadata only the following quantities can be read in:
   * Positions

   * Velocities

   * Masses

   * Particle IDs

   * Internal energy of gas particles

   * Density of gas particles

   The precision and endian-ness of the data is determined automatically
from the Fortran record markers.

3.1.2 Gadget type 2 binary
--------------------------

Type 2 binary snapshots include a four character "TAG" before each data
block. By default the following blocks are recognised:

   * POS

   * VEL

   * MASS

   * ID

   * U

   * RHO

   Additional blocks can be read in by adding them to the configuration
file:
     ~/.gadgetviewer_settings/gadget_binary_type2_blocks

Note that only scalar quantities can be read in this way. If the
configuration file does not exist a default file is created when the
program is run.

3.1.3 Gadget HDF5 snapshots
---------------------------

Any dataset in the PartTypeX groups of a HDF5 snapshot can be read as
long as it has one element per particle and is of a floating point or
integer type. By default the following datasets are read:
   * Coordinates

   * Velocity/Velocities

   * Mass/Masses

   * ParticleIDs

   * InternalEnergy

   * Density
   Additional datasets can be read in by editing the configuration file:
     ~/.gadgetviewer_settings/gadget_binary_type2_blocks

If this file does not exist a default file is created when the program
is run.


File: mgpt.info,  Node: Reading group catalogues,  Next: Reading additional arrays,  Prev: Reading snapshots,  Up: Reading simulation data

3.2 Reading group catalogues
============================

FoF and SubFind group catalogues can be read by selecting the
"Auxiliary data/Read groups" option in the File menu and choosing one
file from the set. The name of this file is used as a template to
locate the other files.

   Once a  group catalogue has been read the particles will have
additional integer properties named "FoFGroupIndex" and/or
"SubGroupIndex".  These specify which FoF and/or SubFind group each
particle belongs to.

3.2.1 L-Gadget FoF groups
-------------------------

These consist of group_tab and group_ids files and contain FoF groups
only.

3.2.2 L-SubFind subfind groups
------------------------------

These consist of sub_tab and sub_ids files and contain SubFind groups
only.

3.2.3 P-Gadget3 FoF and SubFind
-------------------------------

These consist of subhalo_tab and subhalo_ids files and contain both FoF
and SubFind groups.


File: mgpt.info,  Node: Reading additional arrays,  Prev: Reading group catalogues,  Up: Reading simulation data

3.3 Reading additional arrays
=============================

Its possible to read in extra particle properties from ascii or HDF5
files using the "Read additional data" option in the file menu. These
files must follow the same naming convention as Gadget snapshots. Each
data array can be split across any number of files as long as there is
one element for each particle in the snapshot and the values are stored
in the same order as in the snapshot.

   Once an extra property has been read the program will look for a
corresponding set of files whenever a new snapshot is loaded. This is
done by replacing any instances of the snapshot number in the
filename(s).

4 Navigation controls
*********************

* Menu:

* Mouse controls::
* Keyboard shortcuts::
* The selected point::


File: mgpt.info,  Node: Mouse controls,  Next: Keyboard shortcuts,  Up: Navigation controls

4.1 Mouse controls
==================

The default mouse controls are as follows:

   * Rotate the view by dragging the left mouse button in the main
     window

   * Zoom in or out by dragging the right mouse button up or down or
     using the scroll wheel

   * Centre on a clump of particles by clicking on it with the middle
     button

   * Move the view in the plane of the screen by dragging with the
     middle button

   These controls can be changed using the "Customise" option in the
"Controls" menu.


File: mgpt.info,  Node: Keyboard shortcuts,  Next: The selected point,  Prev: Mouse controls,  Up: Navigation controls

4.2 Keyboard shortcuts
======================

Most of the menu items have keyboard shortcuts. The key combinations are
displayed next to the corresponding menu items. Where buttons in the
main window have an underlined letter the button can be activated by
pressing Alt and that letter.


File: mgpt.info,  Node: The selected point,  Prev: Keyboard shortcuts,  Up: Navigation controls

4.3 The selected point
======================

The currently selected point is highlighted with a cross and its
coordinates are displayed at the bottom of the main window. If the view
is rotated this point is used as the centre of rotation.

   You can view the average properties of the particles closest to the
selected point using the "Show info" button at the top of the main
window. This locates the N nearest neighbours (N=10 by default) and
calculates the mean of each particle property over those neighbours.

   You can move the selected point to specific coordinates using "Jump
to coordinates" in the "Options" menu.

5 The displayed sample
**********************

Since it is quite easy to read in more particles than can be plotted
while maintaining a reasonable frame rate, the program usually displays
a random sample of the particles. By default up to 250,000 are shown.
When a snapshot is first loaded, if there are more than 250,000
particles a random sample is taken from the full simulation volume.

   The maximum number of particles to show can be changed with the
"View parameters" option in the "View" menu.

* Menu:

* Viewing a sub-region in more detail::
* Viewing the whole volume::


File: mgpt.info,  Node: Viewing a sub-region in more detail,  Next: Viewing the whole volume,  Up: The displayed sample

5.1 Viewing a sub-region in more detail
=======================================

If you zoom in on a particular region of the simulation you can make it
draw a random sample of particles from just that region by clicking the
resample button in the main window. Alternatively you can activate the
automatic resampling option in the View menu. This resamples the
particles whenever the zoom factor changes by some amount. Its best not
to use this in conjunction with the smoothed density plot because the
smoothing lengths are recalculated whenever the particles are resampled.

   The current sampling rate is displayed at the bottom of the main
window. If you zoom in far enough it will reach 100% and all particles
will be visible.


File: mgpt.info,  Node: Viewing the whole volume,  Prev: Viewing a sub-region in more detail,  Up: The displayed sample

5.2 Viewing the whole volume
============================

The "Show all" button at the top of the main window draws a new sample
from the full simulation volume. Use this if you've zoomed in and
resampled and now wish to return to viewing the whole volume.
Alternatively, you can just zoom right out and click the Resample
button.

8 Selecting particles
*********************

"Select particles" under the Options menu allows you to highlight
particles according to property values and/or their distance from the
selected point. It uses the IDs from the snapshot file to identify
particles, so if you have a simulation where the IDs are not unique you
may get strange results. For example, any particle with the same ID as
a selected particle will be selected too. Particles stay selected when
you change snapshots, so you can use this to identify progenitors of a
particular halo, for example.

   It is possible to select up to six different sets of particles
simultaneously. The drop down box at the top of the "Select particles"
window allows you to specify which set to operate on, and you can
specify a name and a colour for each one. The chosen colour is used to
highlight the selected particles in the main display and in the graph
window.


File: mgpt.info,  Node: Making movies,  Next: Plotting graphs,  Prev: Selecting particles,  Up: Top

9 Making movies
***************

Select "Make movie" from the options menu. "Rotating movie" makes a
movie of the particle distribution rotating about the selected point.
"Evolving movie" loops over a range of snapshots and makes one frame
per snapshot, optionally re-centering the view on the selected
particles before calculating each frame. It writes out the frames as
png files so you need to use something like mencoder to encode the
movie.

   Evolving movies will look best if you ensure that the sampling rate
is 100% before making the movie. Otherwise you get a lot of flickering
because it uses a different random sample for each frame.


File: mgpt.info,  Node: Plotting graphs,  Next: Saved settings,  Prev: Making movies,  Up: Top

10 Plotting graphs
******************

"Make plot" in the options menu allows you to plot a histogram of the
values of a particle property or to make a scatterplot of one property
against another (e.g. temperature vs density). Particles in the current
sample are shown in red and each set of selected particles is shown in
the appropriate colour for that set. The plot will update automatically
if you choose a different sample, change snapshots or modify a
selection.

   If the property plotted on the x or y axis cannot be loaded for the
current snapshot the graph window will be blank.
